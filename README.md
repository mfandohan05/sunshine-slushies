ðŸŒž Sunshine Slushies Website
This is a responsive, mobile-first website built for Sunshine Slushies, a local food truck business serving frozen treats, lemonade, and more.

ðŸ”§ My Role
I served as the Lead Developer and UX/UI Designer on this project. My responsibilities included:

Architecture & Structure: I organized the overall HTML layout using semantic elements, ensuring accessibility and responsiveness from the ground up.

Mobile-First Design: I implemented a mobile-first approach using custom CSS and media queries to ensure the site is clean, intuitive, and functional on all devices.

Styling & Animation: I handled all visual design, including typography, hover/focus interactions, brand colors, layout consistency, and CSS transitions for smoother UX.

Slideout Navigation & Interactivity: I built the responsive hamburger menu with JavaScript for smaller screens and included keyboard and mouse interactions.

Grid Layouts: I developed responsive grid structures for both the homepage and full menu to ensure clear, user-friendly content presentation.

Team Coordination: I directed a teammate on the initial class naming and layout structure for both the menu.html and contact.html pages, then refined and styled the content to match the siteâ€™s visual and UX standards.

This project was created as part of a UI design assignment, but I approached it with production-level care and attention to real-world usability.
