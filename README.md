Project Overview

The Sunshine Slushies website is a fully responsive, mobile-first promotional website built for a mobile food truck business specializing in slushies, lemonade, and other treats. The website was designed to be lively, easy to navigate, and visually aligned with the company's cheerful and vibrant branding. It includes a homepage, menu page, and contact page, along with a mobile slideout menu for improved usability on small screens.

My Role

I served as the lead developer, designer, and team coordinator for this project. My responsibilities covered every stage of the site’s development, including:

- Establishing the overall site architecture, design system, and coding standards.

- Fully designing and building the Homepage.

- Directing a team member through the creation of the Menu and Contact Page, providing guidance on structure, required classes, and basic responsive styling.

- Performing comprehensive code review and cleanup across the entire project to ensure consistency, accessibility, and clean code practices.

- Implementing a mobile-first, responsive design with Flexbox and Grid layouts.

- Ensuring all media, including images and embeds, were properly responsive and optimized.

- Handling accessibility considerations, including adding descriptive alt text, maintaining strong color contrast, and supporting keyboard navigation and focus states.

- Integrating UI interactions such as slideout menus with JavaScript and hover/focus effects.

- Testing and troubleshooting the site across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari) and devices (desktop, iPhone).

- Hosting the final version of the site using GitHub Pages.

Technical Highlights

- Built with: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, vanilla JavaScript

- Responsive Design: Mobile-first development with custom media queries.

- UI/UX Design: Bright, cheerful color scheme (#E30613, #FFE600, #FFF9D9), consistent branding, intuitive navigation.

- Accessibility: Focus states added, WCAG AA color contrast compliance, all images properly labeled with alt attributes.

- Performance: Images optimized with lazy loading attributes (loading="lazy"), CSS transitions kept lightweight.

- Clean Code: Semantic HTML elements, consistent class naming conventions, no repeated media queries.

Challenges & Solutions

Safari Browser Bugs: Noticed discrepancies in how Safari handled flexbox and element sizing compared to Chrome. Fixed this by adjusting CSS rules, adding specific Safari-friendly properties like -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch and normalizing button dimensions with flex properties.

Team Code Consistency: Had to identify and merge duplicated media queries and unify different teammates' contributions into a single cohesive style guide.

Slideout Menu Issues: Initial overflow issues were addressed by refining overflow-x: hidden behavior and ensuring the slideout menu used transform for off-screen movement instead of manipulating right properties alone.

Reflection

This project pushed me to hone both my technical skills and my leadership abilities. I had to not only build out high-quality, production-ready pages but also organize, clean up, and guide a team effort to match a high professional standard. I’m proud of how the site turned out and how clearly it reflects a cohesive brand image, excellent responsiveness, and strong attention to usability.
